turnin code:  cs_p1


Write a C/C++ program to perform these actions:

    1.  use atoi(argv[1]) as the arg to srand()
    2.  use atoi(argv[2]) as the number of 3D points to generate
    3.  create a vector of random 3D points (AFTER setting the seed);
        the macro GEN_RAND_3D_PT  in p1demo.c can be used to generate
        each point; 0 and 10000 should be used as the min and max;
    4.  use datatype float to hold coordinates, distances, etc (NOT double)
    5.  use -Ofast to build the program (capital O, not zero)
    6.  print the minimum distance between any pair of points and the
        maximum distance between any pair of points;
        use format  %.3f  to print up to 3 digits after the decimal;
        printed values must be correct to 3 decimal places

Note that it is a waste of time to compute the distance from point 1
to point 2 and then also compute the distance from point 2 to point 1.

It is perhaps simplest to keep a vector of structures where each struct
contains the coordinates of a single point.


Sample runs:
    ./p1 7 3000
    41.569  16069.743

    ./p1 7 33000
    9.270  16822.021

    ./p1 111 33000
    11.466  16867.733

Performance counts.
Those tests should run within about 2 seconds on system64.


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p1.tar ./p1dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After I un-tar your project, I will do this:
        rm -rf p1
        rm -f  *.o
        make
    Your makefile must build an executable named:
        p1
